The main reason is funded on avoiding a shortfall of health care resources while buying time to learn about the disease. In the other hand, current lockdowns are provoking collateral problems, especially in fragile economies, which concerns about the actual sustainability of the system. Under this context, insurance companies need to have a comprehensive and cross-functional view in order to go in line with public decisions and adapt to the society’s reponse. It is critical to constantly evaluate the spread of the virus and assess potential scenarios that may arise during this crisis. With the goal of representing the virus evolution in the following weeks, we propose a dynamic probabilistic framework to estimate the number of confirmed cases in several countries. The structure is based on a Gompertz model whose parameters describe outbreak delay, growth rate and final point. We rely on Bayesian inference that provides a mathematical architecture to 1) Propagate uncertainty from model assumptions to predictions, 2) partially-pool estimates towards the overall common behavior of the pandemic (“borrowing strength” property). 1.2 Data source Even though using “lorem ipsum” often arouses curiosity due to its resemblance to classical Latin, it is not intended to have meaning. Where text is visible in a document, people tend to focus on the textual content rather than upon overall presentation, so publishers use lorem ipsum when displaying a typeface or design in order to direct the focus to presentation. “Lorem ipsum” also approximates a typical distribution of spaces in English. The most common lorem ipsum text reads as follows: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.
